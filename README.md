# Game-Programming-Course-Week-4
In the third week of the Game Programming course, I focused on enhancing my game by implementing enemy mechanics in Unity. This project allowed me to apply concepts related to object interactions, collision detection, and player damage. <br>
This project demonstrates the following fundamental skills:

- Creating an enemy prefab with customizable properties (such as speed and spawn behavior).
- Writing C# scripts to manage enemy movement and behavior.
- Utilizing Unity's `OnTriggerEnter` function to detect collisions between enemies, the player, and laser objects.
- Implementing damage handling for the player upon collision with enemies, thereby adding a challenge to the gameplay.
- Structuring the game to ensure a parent container organizes multiple enemies efficiently.
